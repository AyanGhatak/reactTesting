# React Testing

Its an example react demo-app. It primarily illustrates how to setup **protractor** and **jest** for testing a react application. 

Couple of useful npm scripts are:

* `npm run start` - Starts the dev server and opens the app at http://localhost:3000/.
* `npm run test` - Starts to run the unit and snapshot tests. You can optionally use the `test:watch` or `test:coverage` to run tests in watch mode or to check the test coverage.
* `npm run p:start` - Starts the webdriver(selenium) server which is a pre-requisite step to test using protractor.
* `npm run p:test` - Run e2e tests using protractor.
